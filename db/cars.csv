Chili’s Minivan;Oldsmobile Silhouette;1994;On his trip out to Los Angeles, shylock Chili Palmer (John Travolta) orders a Cadillac from the car rental service, but gets this minivan instead. And Chili is so cool that by the end of the film, the Oldsmobile Silhouette becomes the “must have” car for the discerning filmmaker.
The Dude’s Gran Torino;Ford Gran Torino;1973;It’s rare that a car fits its owner so perfectly, but the Dude and this car are a perfect match. By the time the movie is over, it’s been stolen, vandalized, crashed into a dumpster, and set on fire, but nonetheless, the Dude abides.
Jack Cate’s Cadillac;Cadillac DeVille Convertible;1964;This beat-up Cadillac has definitely seen better days, just like its owner. What’s really sad is that even with access to Reggie’s stolen drug money, Jack spends 25 grand to get another beat-up old Caddy in the sequel.
Lane’s Camaro;Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS 350;1967;Lane Meyer (John Cusack) has hidden this gem under a cover in the driveway for far too long. But his hot new friend Monique helps him get it running again so he can get a taste of winning.
Fozzie’s uncle’s Studebaker;Studebaker Commander;1951;What better car for a cross-country trip than an old Studebaker? Okay, so there are a lot of better cars, but considering that it’s Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear taking the trip, this car fits them pretty well.
The Van;Customized Chevrolet Step Van;1978;Imagine you have a van. Imagine it’s made out of marijiuana (just go with us on this one). Who do you get to drive it? If it’s 1978, then the answer is Cheech & Chong.
The Car;Lincoln Continental Mark III;1971;George Barris customized this Lincoln for a film about an evil car that’s terrorizing a Southwestern town. And this car may look familiar to those who have seen Bender turn into a werecar on Futurama.
Kowalski’s Challenger;Dodge Challenger R/T;1970;The Muscle Car Era inspired a lot of car chase movies, including this one about a cross-country car delivery that turns in to a multi-state car chase. The iconic Challenger was also seen in Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof, used in an exciting game of “Ship’s Mast” (don’t try that one at home, kids!)
Volkswagen Transporter;Volkswagen Transporter (Type 2);1973;The Hoovers have a few problems with their VW Bus: a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a door that comes off. Writer Michael Arndt says that all of those problems happened to his own family on a cross-country trip while he was a kid.
Eleanor;Ford Mustang Mach 1;1973;The original Gone in 60 Seconds had no script, and no real actors, and it shows. But none of that really matters in light of the 40 minute chase scene at the end of the film. That’s where Eleanor, the only real star of the film really shines.
Milner’s Deuce Coupe;Ford Coupe;1932;George Lucas was a hot rod enthusiast, and this film based on his own teenage years in Modesto, California definitely shows that. John Milner’s 1932 Ford introduced a whole new generation to this type of old style hot rod.
Cobretti’s Mercury;Mercury Monterey;1950;Apart from relatively cartoonish violence, Cobretti’s 1950 Merc is probably the most memorable thing about the whole movie. Sadly, the car is completely destroyed by the end of the film.
Tucker Torpedo;Tucker Sedan;1948;In an attempt to start his own manufacturing company, Preston Tucker came up with a car with innovative features and radical styling. The company closed down amid fraud allegations, and only 51 cars were ever made, making the “Tucker Torpedo” a very rare and collectible car.
Flounder’s brother’s Lincoln;Lincoln Continental;1964;While on the ill-fated road trip with Otter, Boon, and Pinto, freshman Delta pledge Flounder severely damages his brother Fred’s Lincoln Continental. But no matter, D-Day “fixes” it just in time for Faber’s annual Homecoming parade.
Charlie Babbit’s Buick;Buick Roadmaster Convertible;1949;This classic convertible is the sum total of Charlie Babbitt’s inheritance, after his father passes away. It’s not the same as getting $3 million, but the car’s true value lies in bringing Charlie together with the brother he never knew he had.
Richard’s classic Plymouth;Plymouth Belvedere GTX;1967;Another road movie with a classic car, but this one gets more and more abuse as the movie goes one. They lose the top. And the hood. And a door. And finally the car catches fire. But at least Tommy and Richard save the company…
Shaggin’ Wagon;Ford Econoline;1984;"Ask Harry and Lloyd; there’s nothing like having a company car. Even if it does look like a giant sheep dog."
Bumblebee;Chevrolet Camaro;1977;Although previously seen as a Volkswaken Beetle, Bumblebee makes his film debut as a 1977 Camaro. But he’s sensitive about how he looks, so he changes himself in to a 2009 Camaro. What else can he change into? A giant robot, natch!
Charlie’s getaway MINIs;MINI Cooper S;2003;"When BMW reintroduced the MINI in 2000, it was only a matter of time before someone got around to remaking The Italian Job. The action moves from Rome to Los Angeles, but the idea is the same; watching MINIs outrun anyone trying to chase them."
Cole Trickle’s race car;Chevrolet Lumina NASCAR;1990;It gets wrecked and rebuilt, and sees multiple paint schemes over the course of the film, but that’s to be expected for a typical NASCAR racing machine.
Toretto’s Charger;Dodge Charger;1970;This is the car that even Dominic Toretto admits he’s afraid of. And what’s better than watching the body twist as the engine revs? But it’s tragic to see this car get wrecked (even if the blower and wheelie bars are faked).
Buck’s Pussy Wagon;Chevrolet C-2500 Silverado Fleetside;1997;Buck is such a sleazebag that we’re glad to see Beatrix kill him. And his ride is as sleazy he is, but at least it’s easy to find in a parking lot.
Garth’s Mirth Mobile;AMC Pacer;1976;Wayne may be cool, but his best buddy Garth isn’t, although he tries to be. Garth’s car is the same way: it’s isn’t actually cool, but it’s really, really trying to be.
The Family Truckster;Ford LTD Country Squire;1981;The producers of Vacation wanted to create an example of a completly disgusting and awful station wagon. It’s ugly, it’s badly engineered, and it’s unreliable. In other words, it’s a typical early 80s American car.
Pursuit Special;Ford Falcon XB GT Coupe;1973;The last of the V8 Interceptors is the only Aussie car on the list, and it’s a doozy. It’s loud, it’s fast, and it just plain looks mean. But it’s also a cop car, which means Max gets to use it to run down evil bikers.
The Mach 5;Racer Motors Mach 5;1990;The Mach 5 historically known for the Japanese animated TV show, but is now the star of this week’s Speed Racer. The physical version of the Mach 5 is gorgeous, and lives up to fans’ high expectations (even though the movie didn’t).
Louise’s Thunderbird;Ford Thunderbird;1966;What is it about Road Movies that require old cars? Probably because a cross-country trip in a luxurious RV isn’t that interesting. In this case, Louise’s classic T-Bird convertible symbolizes the freedom that she and Thelma recklessly pursue.
Pepe, the Little Mule;Ford Bronco XLT;1982;"Now this is our kind of drug mule; four-wheel drive, powerful V8 engine, and easily able to outrun Columbian Secret Police vehicles. Plus it’s driven by Alfonso Arau, who was better known as El Guapo in The Three Amigos."
Greased Lightning;Ford De Luxe;1948;"There are two versions of Greased Lightning; there’s the white one that the T-Birds modify and race, and then there’s the red fantasy version that they dance around on. That’s the one that shows up at the end of the movie, and can apparently fly."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang;Paragon Panther;1940;Although never mentioned in the movie, the original book by Ian Fleming(!) mentions that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang had been a famous race car called the Paragon Panther. In reality, multiple versions were purpose-built for the movie, including a fully functional road-going car.
Christine;Plymouth Fury;1958;"When Plymouth introduced the Fury name in 1957, it was essentially a sport and trim package on the Belvedere model. And the red paint and interior were custom orders; those options weren’t regularly available on the real cars. But what other color works on a demonic, murderous car – beige? We don’t think so."
Joel’s dad’s Porsche;Porsche 928;1981;Joel’s parents leave for the weekend, and tell him not to drive his father’s Porsche, but he just can’t resist. But Porsches aren’t meant to be U-boats, and it costs serious money to repair the water damage before Joel’s parents get home.
The Tumbler;Wayne Industries Assault Vehicle;2001;They never could get the bridge to work, but this baby works just fine, according to Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). In reality, four street-ready versions were built, and were spied driving at extreme speeds (one was also in an accident) in Chicago before the release of Batman Begins.
The Lamborghini;Lamborghini Countach LP 400S;1980;If you were a teenage boy in the 80s, you wanted one of these cars. The black Countach that appears in The Cannonball Run is a standout in a movie filled with hot cars, and it doesn’t hurt that it’s driving by a smoking hot, spandex-wrapped Adrienne Barbeau.
Submersible Lotus;Lotus Esprit;1975;This is the second-coolest car that James Bond ever drove (we’ll get to his best car shortly). It looks good, it handles well, and it’s great for a day at the beach. No boat? No problem!
Eleanor II;Shelby Mustang GT500;1967;Like the Lamborghini in The Cannonball Run, Eleanor stands out in a film full of hot cars. Her appearance has proved so popular that it’s contributed to higher pricing of late-60s Mustang fastbacks, and there’s now a cottage industry based on creating Eleanor replicas.
Ben’s Alfa Romeo;Alfa Romeo 1600 Spider Duetto;1966;The success of The Graduate turned the Alfa Romeo Spider into a worldwide icon, and definitely boosted sales of the car. The car’s fame and longevity would eventually inspire Alfa Romeo to introduce a “Graduate” edition.
George Barris Batmobile;Lincoln Futura;1954;Already famous as a star of the Batman TV show, the 1960s Batmobile made the jump to the big screen in 1966. This is probably the most iconic George Barris design, and it’s based on the Lincoln Futura concept car.
Charlie’s Getaway Minis;Austin Mk I Mini Cooper S;1968;The Mini was already a popular car in 1969, but The Italian Job is what helped make the car a legend in Europe. That, and a succession of mid-sixties Monte Carlo Rally wins. Although Michael Caine and Noel Coward are the stars of the movie, the Minis really steal the show.
The Bluesmobile;Dodge Monaco;1974;After trading the orginal Bluesmobile (a Cadillac) for a microphone, Elwood picked this gem up at the Mount Prospect city police auction. “They were practically giving them away!”
Mr. Frye’s Ferrari;Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder SWB;1961;Cameron says his father loves this car more than life itself. Ferris scoffs at his priorities, but does highly recommend picking one up, if you have the means. It’s a simply beautiful car, and fortunately the filmmakers destroy a mere replica, not the real thing.
Tim Burton’s Batmobile;GM Batmobile;1989;The 1989 Batman needed to overcome a lot of the camp baggage left by the old TV show, and the new Batmobile was big step in that direction. Although the 1960s Batmobile was cool, this new one was simply mind-blowing.
Starsky’s Gran Torino;Ford Gran Torino;1976;The long-running TV show helped make this car popular, but it’s the 2004 film the qualifies the iconic red Gran Torino hot rod for a high rank on the list. About ten of the cars were destroyed during filming, and only a couple have survived.
Bandit’s Trans Am;Pontiac Trans Am;1977;Burt Reynolds’ previous stint as bootlegger in White Lightning involved a relatively boring Ford 500. But this time around, he drives the outrageously-styled Trans Am, complete with the “Flaming Chicken” decals.
Ecto-1;Cadillac Miller-Meteor;1959;According to Ray, it just needs some suspension work and shocks. Brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear-end. Also new rings, mufflers, a little wiring. But hey, the old ambulance was only $4800. That’s only about $10,000 when scaled up for inflation.
JB’s Aston Martin DB5;Aston Martin DB5;1963;This car is as much a part of James Bond lore as is the Walther PPK. Sean Connery can be seen driving it in Goldfinger and Thunderball, Pierce Brosnan drives one in Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies, Daniel Craig drives one in Casino Royale, and Roger Moore uses one to goof on himself in The Cannonball Run.
Bullitt’s Mustang;Ford Mustang GT390 Fastback;1968;Bullitt may be the coolest movie by the coolest actor ever, Steve McQueen. So naturally, his car has to be cool, too. Two identical Mustangs were used for filming the iconic chase scene; one was scrapped after filming, and it’s rumored that the surviving car has been stored in a barn in the Ohio River Valley.
The General Lee;Dodge Charger;1969;Dumb movie, dumb TV show, awesome car. The General Lee is proof that you can keep a TV show on the air for 6 seasons simply based on the popularity of a single car (and Catherine Bach in tight shorts). Like some other cars on this list, the General was mainly known for TV, but found regained popularity when jumping to the big screen.
Herbie;Model 117 Volkswagen Type 1 (Beetle);1963;The 1968 Disney film The Love Bug was partly inspired by and helped push along the Beetle craze in the 1960s. The little grey race car with a lot of personality has since gone on to star in 4 sequels and a TV movie, with co-stars ranging from Bruce Campbell to Lindsay Lohan. Why is Herbie at #2 on this list? Try finding someone who doesn’t know who Herbie is.
Doc Brown’s De Lorean;De Lorean DMC-12;1981;The Back to the Future movies were all blockbusters, and were all based around one thing – a De Lorean-turned-time machine invented by the eccentric Doctor Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd).
